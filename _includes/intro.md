#The Redgate style guide

This guide contains advice about how to write and format anything read by people outside the company, including documentation, marketing copy, surveys, emails, and error messages.

Note that this style guide contradicts lots of our existing writing, because things have changed since then, or because there was no fixed style at the time, or someone was drunk.

Feel free to add entries or comment on existing ones. If you add an entry, please place it in the right place alphabetically.

If you have any questions, or if youâ€™re Waitrose and would like to complain about that lightning talk, hassle [James Duffy](http://twitter.com/virtualjaaames), Tom Crossman, [Beth Aitman](https://twitter.com/baitman), or another friendly member of the tech comms team.
